# Observability Pipeline for SNMP-enabled IoT Devices

## Overview
This project provides a lightweight, containerised observability pipeline designed for data scientists and engineers working with SNMP-enabled IoT devices (e.g., PDUs, environmental sensors). The pipeline is built using Docker, Docker Compose, Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana. It features structured logging, automated configuration, and operates in two modes: synthetic (for testing) and SNMP (for real devices).

## Features
- Modular, containerised architecture
- Python-based launcher and teardown scripts
- Real-time data visualisation with Grafana
- Time-series data storage in InfluxDB
- Synthetic mode for demo and debugging
- SNMP polling for real devices
- Structured logging with daily rotation
- Git-friendly device configuration using JSON

## Requirements
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Python 3.7+

## Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/observability-pipeline.git
cd observability-pipeline

### 2. Run in Synthetic Mode
python launch_pipeline.py --synthetic

### 3. Run in SNMP Mode
Edit devices.json with your SNMP device details:
[
  {
    "id": "pdu-1",
    "ip": "fd00::1",
    "version": "2c",
    "community": "public"
  }
]

Then launch:
python launch_pipeline.py --devices

### 4. Stop the Pipeline
python stop_pipeline.py

## Grafana Dashboard
Access the Grafana UI at:
http://localhost:3000

Default login:
Username: admin
Password: admin

Preloaded dashboards will appear automatically. You can modify or clone them via the Grafana UI.

## Logging
Log files are stored in the logs/ directory with filenames like:
logs/05-07-2025-obsci.log

These contain:
- Launch parameters
- Docker image versions
- SNMP device summary
- Telegraf logs

## Extensibility
Future enhancements can include:
- MQTT and Modbus protocol support
- Container health checks and alerts
- Remote Grafana access with user authentication
- Log streaming to external monitoring stacks

## Testing & Stability
The pipeline is designed to run on modest systems (e.g., 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM) and tested for fast startup (~10s), with full readiness in ~30s.
